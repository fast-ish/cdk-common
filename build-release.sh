# Build script that temporarily sets a release version, builds all artifacts, then sets to next version
#
# Usage:
#   ./build-release.sh <release-version> <next-version>
#
# Examples:
#   # Build 1.0.0 release, then go back to snapshot
#   ./build-release.sh 1.0.0 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
#
#   # Build 1.0.0 release, then move to next minor snapshot
#   ./build-release.sh 1.0.0 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT
#
#   # Build 1.0.0 release, then move to next major snapshot
#   ./build-release.sh 1.0.0 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
#
#   # Build release candidate, then go back to snapshot
#   ./build-release.sh 2.0.0-rc1 2.0.0-SNAPSHOT
#
# This script will:
#   1. Set all module versions to <release-version>
#   2. Run mvn clean install to build all artifacts
#   3. Set all module versions to <next-version>
